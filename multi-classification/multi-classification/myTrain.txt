LOW		we we on a sunday around 11am we got seated right away . <sssss> the menu is trying to be like a new-american style type of menu . <sssss> i ordered chicken and waffles and the bo ordered a breakfast burrito . <sssss> our meals took around 25 minutes to come out and my boyfriend even commented saying how all the people sitting next to us no one had a plate in front of them . <sssss> sunday must have been a new employee training day because there was so many kids wandering around and around the restaurant with no real task at hand . <sssss> the coffee ... the coffee was good . <sssss> then , finally our food came out . <sssss> my chicken was good and it was a baked chicken breast breaded . <sssss> my waffle was half a waffle . <sssss> two pieces came out and they were toasted cajun style -lrb- like a brick -rrb- i think they were seasoned with a pepper or something too ? <sssss> my scrambled eggs came out already mixed with syrup . <sssss> boy 's burrito came out on a green pita wrap tortilla and carne mixed with eggs and some avocado on the side . <sssss> the `` carne '' or meat had a lot of fat on it . <sssss> breakfast was $ 30 . <sssss> i wont be back .
